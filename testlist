----MAG Test List----
Run Cases:
1. with bench1 run restart
*Start with par.bnch1:
 init=0404, (initial temp perturbation l=4, m=4  is imposed)
 treset=.true.,
 samp=0.1000,
 nstep=200,
 nprnt=08,
 nstor=04,
*rename the last output file d3.bench1 to "initfile", and modify par.bnch1 as following
 infile="initfile",
 init=0,
 treset=.true.,
 samp=0.1000,
 nstep=800,
 nprnt=08,
 nstor=08,
*run restart a few times, each time rename d7.bench1 to "initfile"
compare output with published benchmark 
 

 
2. produce unformated data for magsym.pro data process
   set ngfom=2 for unformated file
   g file size is half of the formatted one
   
3. dtmax, the maximum(initial) time step
    set dtmax= 0.25e-4 = 0.000025 in bench1
    dtmax < 0.25*Ekman (Ekman=1.0e-3)
    is bench1 unstable? when dtmax=0.25e-3
    
4. courfac determines dt limit, set to 3, 4 in bench1 with dtmax=1.5e-4
   larger courfac gives smaller dt
   reduce courfac would reduce run time, program running more efficent. It is a balanced act
   
5. radratio ri/ro =0.35 (bench1, bench0)
   set to:        =0.8
   				  =0.1
   		
   		
6. Rayleigh number: Ra = 1.0e5=100000 in bench1   	
   set to                3.0e4
                         6.0e4
                         3.0e5	
   		
7. Prandtl number Pr stable, Pr=1.0 in bench1

8. Magnetic Prandtl number Prmag = 0.5 -10, Prmag=5.0 in bench1
   set Prmag = 10 for test
   
9. bpeak = -5 in bench1, poloidal dipole

10. boundary conditions:
 							ktops = 1 fixed temp at CMB
 							ktops = 2 fixed radial heatflow @CMB
 							kbots = 1 fixed temp at ICB
 							kbots = 2 fixed radial heatflow at ICB
 							ktopv = 1 velocity condition is free at CMB
 							kbotv = 2 velocity condition is rigid at CMB
 							ktopb = 1 for insulation inner core
 							ktopb = 2 for ideally conduction inner core
 							kbotb = 1 for insulating mantle (fixed)
 							imagcon < 0 
 		   bnch1 	
 	ktops	1		2	1	2
 	kbots	1		2	2	1
 	ktopv	2					1	1	2
 	kbotv	2					2	1	1
 	ktopb	1								2	
 	kbotb	1					            1
					x 	y	y	y	y	y	y		  
	
	When ktops and kbots both set to 2, i.e. fixed radial heatflow at both CMB and ICB, MAG crashes.
	
	
11. Movie file generation:

	imovopt:	100 -> mm.
				010 -> ma.
				001 -> me.
   				0001-> me.
   				1111-> me. ma. mm. cc. 
                1001-> cc. me.
                1000-> cc.
 
 
 
 
 
 IDL:
 
 1. magsym.pro to read in unformated data
