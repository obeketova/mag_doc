Who Will Use This Document
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This documentation is aimed at scientists who prefer to use prepackaged
 and specialized analysis tools.
 Users are likely to be experienced computational Earth scientists and have
 familiarity with basic scripting, software installation, and programming;
 but are not likely to be professional programmers.
 Of those, there are likely to be two classes of users: those who just run
 models and those who modify the source code.

\begin_layout Chapter
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dynamo codes represent a powerful new tool for the quantitative study of
 a broad range of geophysical processes, ranging from short time-scale phenomena
 such as magnetic variations, rotational variations, and flow in the core,
 to long-term phenomena such as magnetic excursions, reversals, superchrons,
 and the evolution of the core and its thermal and chemical interaction
 with the mantle.
 The primary objective of CIG in this area is to provide the Earth Science
 community with robust, reliable, efficient, flexible, state-of-the-art
 numerical codes for modeling dynamo processes in the Earth's core and in
 the interiors of other planets.
 Another CIG objective is to support graphical- and user-interfaces for
 these codes that allow Earth scientists to analyze, display, and interpret
 dynamo code results, and to compare results from the various codes that
 we support, as well as with geomagnetic, space magnetic, and paleomagnetic
 data.

\begin_layout Section
About MAG
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MAG is a serial version of Gary Glatzmaier's rotating spherical convection/magne
toconvection/dynamo code, modified by Uli Christensen and Peter Olson.
 The code solves the non-dimensional Boussinesq equations for time-dependent
 thermal convection in a rotating spherical shell filled with an electrically
 conducting fluid.
 The equations of motion are: the Navier-Stokes equation including Coriolis,
 Lorentz, Buoyancy, pressure, viscous, and inertial terms; the heat equation
 including advection, diffusion, and uniform-density heat sources; the continuit
y equation for velocity and Gauss' law for magnetic field; and the induction
 equation for the magnetic field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All variables are non-dimensional (see Appendix 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cha:Variables-used-in}

\end_inset

); time scale is viscous diffusion, length scale is shell thickness, temperature
 scale is boundary temperature difference, magnetic field and electric currents
 use Elsasser number scaling.
 A variety of boundary and initial conditions has been selected as options.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mag uses toroidal-poloidal decomposition for velocity and magnetic field
 with explicit time steps.
 Linear terms are evaluated spectrally (spherical harmonics plus Chebyshev
 polynomials in radius) and nonlinear terms are evaluated on a spherical
 grid.

Running MAG
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Using MAG
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For test-running the code, perform the following steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Uncompress all files, and create a path (see 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Prepare-MAG-for}

\end_inset

) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Link the grid parameter file to 
\family typewriter
\size small
param.f
\family default
\size default
,
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard
To change grids or symmetry (in 
\family typewriter
\size small
param.f
\family default
\size default
), MAG needs to be recompiled.
 The code looks for 
\family typewriter
\size small
param.f
\family default
\size default
, which needs to be changed for remaking.
 Examples of 
\family typewriter
\size small
param.f 
\family default
\size default
are 
\family typewriter
\size small
param32s6.f
\family default
\size default
 and 
\family typewriter
\size small
param32s4.f
\family default
\size default
.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 which enters into most subroutines through ``include'' statements.
 For example, a grid parameter file named 
\family typewriter
\size small
param32f4.f
\family default
\size default
 (32 spherical harmonics truncation degree, longitude symmetry is 4) is
 linked using
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout LyX-Code
$ ln -sf param32s4.f param.f 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Compile the program with:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout LyX-Code
$ make
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
$ mv magx magx32s4 
\family roman
\size small
(Renaming is optional)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
MAG uses a standard input file.
 Background execute using 
\family typewriter
\size small
par.XXX
\family default
\size default
 as the input file and 
\family typewriter
\size small
.YYY
\family default
\size default
 as the output file's extension:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout LyX-Code
$ magx32s4 <par.XXX >p.YYY &
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For running with the benchmark input files (
\family typewriter
\size small
par.bnch0
\family default
\size default
 or 
\family typewriter
\size small
par.bnch1
\family default
\size default
) , the execution statement should be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
$ magx32s4 <par.bnch0 >p.bench0 &
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
If there is a problem with the input file list, it is often the final three
 lines; with some systems, a 
\family typewriter
\size small
``$
\family default
\size default
'' may be required at the end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
MAG produces a series of output files.
 For example, when using input file 
\family typewriter
\size small
par.bnch0
\family default
\size default
 (the example in step 4) MAG generates: 
\family typewriter
l.bench0,
\family default
\size small
 
\family typewriter
\size default
ls.bench0, g[i].bench0 
\family default
and 
\family typewriter
d[i].bench0
\family default
, where i=0,1,2...9.

Changing Parameters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Physical and time-step parameters can be changed in the par-file namelist
 without re-compiling MAG.
 See Appendix B for a list of the input parameter names and definitions.
 Grid parameters must be changed in 
\family typewriter
\size small
param.f
\family default
\size default
 and MAG must be then re-compiled.
 There are some numerical restrictions on the grid parameter combinations,
 which are given in Appendix A.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you finish running MAG, you should have a series of output data files.
 To visualize your results, the MAG software package provides a set of IDL
 routines found in the directory called 
\family typewriter
PREFIX/idl
\family default
, where 
\family typewriter
PREFIX
\family default
 is the directory under which you installed MAG.
 We should mention here that IDL is a commercial visualization tool by 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \htmlurl[ITT Visual Information Solutions]{www.ittvis.com/idl}

\end_inset

.
 A free IDL compatible program called 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \htmlurl[GDL]{gnudatalanguage.sourceforge.net}

\end_inset

 works with MAG's line plot IDL procedure 
\family typewriter
\size small
MAGTS.pro
\family default
\size default
, but not with the interactive IDL procedures in MAG.

Procedures 
\family typewriter
\size small
MAGTS.pro
\family default
\size default
 and 
\family typewriter
\size small
MAGXY.pro
\family default
\size default
 take data from l-files generated by MAG and create time series plots and
 statistics.
 This version reads an l-file consisting of 17 time series, the first record
 being dimensionless time (see Appendix 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cha:MAG-Output-File}

\end_inset

 for details on output file format).
 Energies and rms magnetic field and velocity are scaled as in MAG; tilt
 is dipole vector colatitude; pole longitude is dipole vector longitude.
 Figures

Interactive IDL Procedures 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
\size small
MAGSYM.pro
\family default
\size default
 is an interactive procedure display which results from a g-file produced
 by MAG.
 This version uses modified IDL color tables and assumes formatted input.
 It creates either postscript 
\family typewriter
\size small
.ps
\family default
\size default
 or 
\family typewriter
\size small
.gif
\family default
\size default
 files.
 If other output file formats are required, you must modify ``LABELOUT.''
 MAGSYM has many plot options: map, closeup, equator, slice, etc.
 Producing each plot is straightforward and accomplished by choosing from
 the option menu.
 Figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:IDL-figure-with}

 is plotted with the map option.

\begin_layout Standard
MAGVOL.pro is another interactive IDL procedure to display volume results
 from rotating convection, magnetoconvection and dynamo calculations (written
 by P.
 Olson).
 It uses g-files produced by MAG (some longitudinal symmetry may be assumed
 in the g-file).
 This version uses modified IDL color tables and assumes formatted or unformatte
d input (it asks for 
\family typewriter
\size small
.gif
\family default
\size default
 but creates 
\family typewriter
.jpg
\family default
 files); if other output file formats are required, modifications of ``labelout'
' are required.
 This version assumes x-window screen graphics; for other graphics devices,
 change the 
\family typewriter
set_plot
\family default
,'
\family typewriter
x
\family default
' and 
\family typewriter
tvrd()
\family default
 commands accordingly.
 MAGVOL procedure creates volume-rendered images of temperature, helicity,
 the z-component of vorticity, kinetic and magnetic energy, joule heating,
 work by Lorentz forces and buoyancy forces.

\begin_layout Chapter
Examples
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Included in this chapter are two benchmark cases and a reversal dynamo case.
 We will present the cases with their input parameters and a typical run
 of the case with output data analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Benchmark Cases 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Historically, these are the cases defined in the benchmark study published
 in the 2001 paper by Gary Glatzmaier et al.
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{benchmark cases}

\end_inset

.
 Case 0 is a benchmark of rotating non-magnetic convection.
 Case 1 is a dynamo with an insulating inner core co-rotating with the outer
 boundary.
 The regions outside the fluid shell are electrical insulators and the magnetic
 field on the boundaries matches with appropriate potential fields in the
 exterior that imply no external sources of the field.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In both cases the Ekman number is 
\begin_inset Formula $E=10$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $^{-3}$
\end_inset

 and the Prandtl number is 
\begin_inset Formula $Pr=1$
\end_inset

.
 The Rayleigh number is set to 
\begin_inset Formula $Ra=100000$
\end_inset

.
 Note that the definition of the Rayleigh number differs from the one in
 the published cases 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{benchmark cases}

\end_inset

 by a factor of Ekman number 
\begin_inset Formula $E,$
\end_inset

 i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $Ra=\frac{Ra}{E}$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{benchmark cases}

\end_inset

 The magnetic Prandtl number is zero in the non-magnetic convection case
 0, and is 
\begin_inset Formula $Pm=5$
\end_inset

 in case 1.
 The spherical harmonic expansion is truncated at degree 
\begin_inset Formula $lmax=32$
\end_inset

 and a four-fold symmetry is assumed in the longitudinal direction (
\family typewriter
param.f
\family default
 should be linked to 
\family typewriter
param32s4.f
\family default
 when you compile MAG).
 The input parameter files are 
\family typewriter
par.bench0
\family default
 for case 0 and 
\family typewriter
par.bench1
\family default
 in case 1; both files reside in the 
\family typewriter
~/src
\family default
 directory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The output files of the benchmark cases are stored in the directory 
\family typewriter
~/bench-data/data_bench0
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
~/bench-data/data-bench1
\family default
 respectively.
 In the following table we see the solutions from MAG agree with the benchmark
 suggested value with a small difference margin.
 In both case 0 and case 1, the values listed were obtained with low resolution
 and a relatively short run of MAG.

\begin_layout Section
Gauss Coefficients Conversion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Making the output useful to the wider community is one of MAG's primary
 goals.
 In this release MAG includes Gauss coefficients in the output file.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is some background: To extrapolate the magnetic field between the core,
 the Earth's surface, and nearby space requires a spherical harmonic representat
ion.
 MAG uses fully-normalized, complex-valued spherical harmonics for its magnetic
 field and other variables.
 These harmonics are packed into one-dimensional arrays for optimal computation
 and they are also made non-dimensional in MAG.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast, the geomagnetism scientific community has a completely different
 standard.
 They 
\series bold
\emph on
always
\series default
\emph default
 use real-valued, un-normalized spherical harmonics, whose coefficients
 are called the Gauss coefficients.
 The Gauss coefficients -- denoted by g(l,m) and h(l,m) respectively, where
 (l,m) are harmonic degree and order, respectively -- are real-valued and
 have dimensional units, usually expressed in nanoTeslas.
 For example, the present-day axial dipole field has a Gauss coefficient
 near g(1,0)=-29,000 nT, the minus sign indicating the field points radially
 inward in the northern hemisphere.
 Users from that whole community often just want dynamo model output consisting
 of standardized files of the Gauss coefficients at various times.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is an overview of the components of the code, input parameters, structure
 of output files, etc.
 MAG expects Unix-styled ASCII files (i.e., no carriage-return character following
 new line character) for all input files.
 This can be a nuisance in DOS/Windows systems.
 You may want to find a text editor that can write Unix-style ASCII files.
 All parameters are in non-dimensional units unless specified.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
 document, but changing it is not allowed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Preamble
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
 share and change it.
 By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your
 freedom to share and change free software -- to make sure the software
 is free for all its users.
 This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's
 software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.
 (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library
 General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
 Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
 freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service
 if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
 that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs;
 and that you know you can do these things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
 to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
 distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
 or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
 You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
 And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We protect your rights with two steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Copyright the software, and 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
 and/or modify the software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
 everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.
 If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
 recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any
 problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'
 reputations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
 We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
 individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
 To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed
 for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
 follow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION
 AND MODIFICATION 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
 placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms
 of this General Public License.
 The ``Program,'' below refers to any such program or work, and a ``work
 based on the Program'' means either the Program or any derivative work
 under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
 portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
 into another language.
 (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term ``modifica
tion.'') Each licensee is addressed as ``you.''
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
 by this License; they are outside its scope.
 The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
 Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
 Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
 Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code
 as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropria
tely publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer
 of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and
 to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program
 a copy of this License along with the Program.
 
\newline

\newline
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
 may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
 thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
 modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that
 you also meet all of these conditions: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
 you changed the files and the date of any change.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
 in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to
 be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms
 of this License.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
 you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
 most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
 copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying
 that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program
 under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
 License.
 (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally
 print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
 to print an announcement.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.
 If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves,
 then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
 distribute them as separate works.
 But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
 work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the
 terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to
 the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
 it.
 
\newline

\newline
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
 rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
 the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
 based on the Program.
 
\newline

\newline
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
 with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
 storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
 scope of this License.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section
 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and
 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,
 which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on
 a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give
 any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing
 source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
 source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
 on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute
 corresponding source code.
 (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only
 if you received the program in object code or executable form with such
 an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
 modifications to it.
 For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code
 for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
 plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
 However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include
 anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)
 with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
 system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
 the executable.
\newline

\newline
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
 access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access
 to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the
 source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
 along with the object code.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
 expressly provided under this License.
 Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program
 is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
 However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
 License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
 remain in full compliance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
 However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
 Program or its derivative works.
 These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
 Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based
 on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,
 and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 the Program or works based on it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
 the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor
 to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
 You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise
 of the rights granted herein.
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this
 License.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement
 or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are
 imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict
 the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions
 of this License.
 If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations
 under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence
 you may not distribute the Program at all.
 For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
 of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
 you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would
 be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
\newline

\newline
If any portion of
 this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance
, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole
 is intended to apply in other circumstances.
\newline

\newline
It is not the purpose of this
 section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims
 or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose
 of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which
 is implemented by public license practices.
 Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
 distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of
 that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose
 that choice.
 
\newline

\newline
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
 a consequence of the rest of this License.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries
 either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
 holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographic
al distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution
 is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
 In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in
 the body of this License.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
 the General Public License from time to time.
 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
 may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 
\newline

\newline
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.
 If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
 to it and ``any later version,'' you have the option of following the terms
 and conditions either of that version or of any later version published
 by the Free Software Foundation.
 If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
 choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
 whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask
 for permission.
 For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write
 to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
 Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
 of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and
 reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
 THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
 PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ``AS IS'' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
 use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
 which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To do so, attach the following notices to the program.
 It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectivel
y convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
 ``copyright'' line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
 Copyright (C) (year) (name of author) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
 under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
 Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)
 any later version.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
 ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS
 FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
 with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when
 it starts in an interactive mode: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes
 with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
 This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain
 conditions; type `show c' for details.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
 parts of the General Public License.
 Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show
 w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items -- whatever
 suits your program.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
 school, if any, to sign a ``copyright disclaimer'' for the program, if
 necessary.
 Here is a sample; alter the names: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovisi
on' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

\begin_layout Standard
This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
 proprietary programs.
 If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful
 to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.
 If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License
 instead of this License.
